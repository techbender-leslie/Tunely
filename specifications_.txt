# Introduction

Dear development team, it is a pleasure to be working with you. I hope you can use 
technology and computer programming to make me a cool site to keep track of my 
Acid Techno record collection. (Acid techno is just techno with a less mellow vibe.)

Here's an example for inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo3StFtLIlM

## Project Objectives

I have a lot of acid techno albums on vinyl! ('I' being your client, not your lead dev. He just listens to music on 
spotify and youtube like a good red blooded millennial.)

I want to be able to keep track of all of these albums and I am tired of alphabetizing and 
re-alphabitizing my shelves. I'm a hardware guy, and I created a complex system of led lights
rigged to my album shelves. Each slot has a little red light that I can make light up to show
me where the album is looking for if I input an ID number. 

What I need is to be able to look through my albums,
click each album to see details,
create an new album,
Edit an albums info,
and delete an album. 

I need each album to have a unique id. Is that going to cost me extra?

Later I would like to add songs. I'm also a DJ. And a microbiologist and as a 
hobby I make miniature furniture out of reclaimed toothpicks. 

I would like to see each song on an album with the name of it and VERY importantly
the BPMs. 

This is less critical than the album part. All of that should be done first.  

## Site User Roles - I'll be the only user. This will help me DJ at the 
Lonely Toad Underground Speakeasy and Day Care Center. (my regular gig)

## Functional Requirements Per User Role - Do the stuff to the data. Was it Schmutz? or Crud? I think it was Crud. 

## Design Specifications - This sould look like acid techno sounds. Basically sharp as hell. Mostly black with some 
bright as hell colors. 

## Success Criteria - I can see an album, get the id from it to put into my LED shelf setup, and see the BPM of each song.

## Content Plan - I will supply you with some seed data soon. 

## Project Timeline - by this afternoon. Is that enough time? Maybe Monday would be OK. Would that cost extra?

## Budget - free coffee, "exposure", and "experience" as well as "something for your portfolio". I don't want to pay money. I suck.
